In the project, we performed a behavioural test, targeting the communicative skills of dogs, on a large, well defined population of laboratory beagles, bred and housed under highly standardized conditions. The test utilized the so-called ‘unsolvable problem’ paradigm (Topal et al. 1997). In this, dogs are allowed to explore an unsolvable food-search problem and the propensity of the dog to seek human con- tact and cooperation is measured. The aims were to evaluate within-breed variation and heritability in human-directed con- tact seeking behaviour.
